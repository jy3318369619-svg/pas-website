# PNS Website - Fix Blank Index.html Issue

## Problem ✅ RESOLVED
- index.html opens as blank page when opened directly in browser
- This is a React/Vite application that requires a development server

- [x] Install dependencies (npm install)
- [x] Start development server (npm run dev)
- [x] Test application in browser at http://localhost:5178/
- [x] Verify all routes work (Home, Products navigation tested)
- [x] Check for console errors (minor warnings only, no blocking errors)

## Status ✅ COMPLETED
The React application is now running successfully! 

### How to use:
1. Run `npm run dev` in terminal
2. Open http://localhost:5178/ in your browser
3. The website will load with all features working:
   - Beautiful animated silk background
   - Navigation between pages
   - Product categories
   - Responsive design

### Note:
Never open index.html directly in browser for React apps - always use the development server!
